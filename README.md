# Argonaut Toolkit

Abstract: Decentralized Governance for Nonprofits and other entities based around Holacratic ideas of flat governance and role definations. Features a new type of token, Taxable Token, used for continous and sustainable funding for non profits, ENS based org and chapter topography identification, and deployment on QtumX PoA chain with Plasma ERC20 (taxable token) on Qtum Mainnet for backing org funds with native token (Qtum) at the same time keeping governance transactions free and easy. 

# Taxable Token QRC-20 Mintable
The Taxable Token is a new specification of a type of token that is continously minted. During contract creation the token is pegged to a ratio in the native token, then anyone is able to mint new tokens by depositing the native token into the contract. The contract also takes in a taxrate at the begining of 

For example, if the ratio is set 1 QTUM : 100 Tokens, with a tax rate of 20%, then for every 1 QTUM sent to the contract, the sender will receive 80 tokens, with 20 tokens being taxed and sent to the beneficiary. In the example of a non profit, you might have an admin chapter which takes the taxed tokens, and regular org chapters which petition for local events or local sponsorship, which donors could fund directly with their tokens.

=> Write tests to ensure the bounds of the contract work as expected
=> Add multi beneficiary support

# Plasma Implementation
Allows for free transactions on the governance chain, allowing for increased role based transactions to be delegated there without drawing on funds. Also insures that fund allocation is still secure on the mainnet chain.
